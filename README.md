# CreditCard-Fraud
Our primary goal is to analyze the given credit card dataset using different data mining and machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. 

The dataset we used was taken from Kaggle and can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud. This dataset contains European cardholder transactions from September 2013. It was collected and analyzed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (UniversiteÃÅ Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection.

Details of the dataset include the following:

    284,807 transactions that occurred in the span of two days.
    492 transactions are fraudulent transactions


All the algorithms are applied on Upsampled Data

    Logistic Regression
    Linear Discriminant analysis
    CART Decision Trees
    Random Forest
    XGBoost
